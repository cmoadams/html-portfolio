<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Cara Adams, welcome to my web developer project portfolio.</p>

<p>When I'm not working as a full time Program Support Specialist or part time bakery clerk or learning to code I enjoy staying active and spending time with friends and family.<br />
  My favorite way to stay active is with CrossFit. I love the combination of strength training and cardio mixed with the class environment. I have learned so much and met so many people through my gym!<br />
  When I'm not working or working out you can find me with my family and friends or doting over my cat, Louie.</p>

<p>I never thought of myself as a tech savvy person, however, I have always been curious. I am not someone who only wants answers, I want to find out the reason for the answer and how I can reach the solution on my own next time.<br />
  So, I started a full stack web developor class in my free time! I am eager to learn and open myself up to new opportunities and skillsets I never would have imagined.
