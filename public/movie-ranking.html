 <h1>Cara's Movie Recommendations</h1>
 <h2>These are a few of my favorite movies </h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Good Will Hunting</h3>
 <p>A young Matt Damon, a caring Robin Williams, and all the Boston accents you could want. What's not to love?</p>
 <h3>Hot Rod</h3>
 <p>A quick, witty, easy watch. An easy laugh on a Sunday afternoon or to pick you up when feeling down.</p>
 <h3>Dr. Suess's How the Grinch Stole Christmas</h3>
 <p>A cinematic masterpiece. Endlessly quoteable!</p>
